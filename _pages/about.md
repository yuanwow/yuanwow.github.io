# 🍾 Biography
Hi! I’m an incoming PhD student in the [Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering (EEE)](https://www.eee.hku.hk/) at [The University of Hong Kong (HKU)](https://www.hku.hk/), under the supervision of [Prof. Edith Cheuk Han Ngai](https://www.eee.hku.hk/people/echngai/). Previously, I obtained my M.E. degree in Computer Science and Technology in the [School of Artificial Intelligence (SAI)](https://sai.sysu.edu.cn/) at Sun Yat-sen University (SYSU), supervised by [Prof. Xuehe Wang](https://sai.sysu.edu.cn/teacher/234) and B.E. degree in Mechanical Design, Manufacturing and Automation from the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC) in 2022.

My research interests include Distributed Optimization (e.g., Federated Learning), and Large Language Models (LLMs).
